This plugin is just a proof of concept for now. The goal is to have a linter that allows the developer to specify which classes can and can't be used across contexts. For example, a `StripePayment` class that's an implementation detail of the `Payment` context shouldn't be used in the `Order` context.

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

In this bare-bones implementation, classes nested in an `Internal` namespace aren't allowed to be used in other context. In the future, I'll probably provide an `#[Internal]` `#[Expose]` attribute to flag classes as (in)accessible for other contexts.

This idea is inspired by Java's class visibility. In Java, a class is only visible in the package it lives in. You need to explicitly make it `public` to allow others to use it.
